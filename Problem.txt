We would like you to create a booking system for Haydenâ€™s Garage.
The business owner Paul wants to capture the following information and save it to the
database;
Name
Email Address
Phone Number
Vehicle Make & Model
Date & time of booking
Customers should be able to book in 30-minute intervals. The garage is open between
9am and 5:30pm, Monday to Friday. Only 1 booking should be allowed per slot.
It should be possible for Paul to prevent specific days and slots from being booked. Paul
should be able to see upcoming bookings from an admin interface, and be able to filter
to a specific day.
A booking confirmation needs to be emailed to both Paul and the customer.
The technical test should be completed using Laravel, VueJS (or other JS framework)
and contain clean and well commented code.
